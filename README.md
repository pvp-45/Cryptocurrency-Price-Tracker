# Cryptocurrency-Price-Tracker

#Description:
I recently developed a dynamic web application that tracks and displays real-time Bitcoin prices using HTML and JavaScript. This project showcases my skills in web development, data retrieval, and user interface design.

Key Features:

Real-time Updates: The application fetches the latest Bitcoin price from a cryptocurrency API and updates it in real-time, providing users with accurate and up-to-date information.

Automated Refresh: To ensure users always have access to the most current information, I implemented an automatic data refresh mechanism, updating the Bitcoin price every minute without the need for manual intervention.

Error Handling: In cases where the API request fails, the application gracefully handles errors, providing users with informative messages while maintaining a polished user interface.

Technologies Used:

HTML: The project's structure and content are built using HTML, providing a solid foundation for the webpage.

JavaScript: The core functionality of the application is powered by JavaScript. I employed JavaScript to make asynchronous HTTP requests, update the DOM in real-time, and manage the auto-refresh feature.

Learning Outcomes:

Through this project, I deepened my understanding of web development concepts, including DOM manipulation, event handling, and asynchronous programming.

I honed my skills in working with APIs, retrieving data from external sources, and presenting it to users in a user-friendly format.

I improved my problem-solving abilities by implementing error handling to ensure a smooth user experience even in less-than-ideal network conditions.

This project not only provides a valuable service by keeping users informed about cryptocurrency prices but also demonstrates my capabilities as a web developer with a focus on creating user-centric and visually appealing web applications.
